# Predict-Historical-Artist
This model attempts to predict the artist by looking at the artwork of 50 of the world's most influential artists of all time.
It is built using transfer learning on a ResNet50 model (making use of the fastai library for deep learning) along with progressive resizing.
The dataset used was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time.
